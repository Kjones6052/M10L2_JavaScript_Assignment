JavaScript Control Structures and Functions


Exploring Conditional Statements and Loops


Objective: 

The aim of this assignment is to familiarize students with conditional statements and loops in JavaScript and enhance their problem-solving skills using these control 
structures.


Problem Statement: 

You are tasked with creating a JavaScript program that simulates a simple online shopping experience. The program should allow users to browse products, add them to a 
cart, and calculate the total cost of their purchase.


Task 1: 
Implement a conditional statement to check if a user is logged in. This doesn't need to be anything complex, a simple let loggedIn = true will do.
status: COMPLETE

Task 2: 
If they are logged in, loop over the 'cart' array below and log the list of available products to the user. If they are not logged in, tell the user they will need to 
log in before they can view their cart.
status: COMPLETE


Exploring Functions in JavaScript
